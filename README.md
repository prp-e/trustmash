# Trustmash

Trustmash is a simple implementation of [Elo's Rating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), which is somehow the founding algorithm of Facebook. I was just idle and tired, I had a lot of useless tweets where I told people _not trust_ each other. So, I tried to make a gimmick program from those tweets. It needs an index page and I will create that soon.
